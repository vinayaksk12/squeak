File downloader for kiva.org to download snapshots in stream.

This project is developed to give a demo of the work.

Start:

Run startup.sh file using following command:

    sh startup.sh

Or make the startup.sh script executable with following command:

    chmod +x startup.sh

and then execute the script as follows:

    ./startup.sh


NOTE: The script is developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with python 2.5. This
should work successfully on all the platforms. For Windows additional
installation might be needed to be done, which are out of scope for the demo
purpose.
